Feature Request: Add Preview to Search Results
February 22, 2019


OBJECTIVE
Add the ability to listen to a preview of the tracks in the search results.
BACKGROUND 
Since the Jamming search includes songs, artists, and albums, many of the results will not match users’ expectations.  Likewise, many songs have the same name and simply seeing a list of results makes selecting the desired song challenging.
Adding a preview link for the results in Jamming will help users determine which search result matches the track they are seeking. 
TECHNICAL DESIGN
Spotify includes a “preview_url” endpoint, which is a string containing the URL to a 30 second preview of the track. This would need to be added to the following files.
Spotify.js
In order to access this endpoint, it needs to be added as a property of the track mapping code (bolded below for emphasis):
return jsonResponse.tracks.items.map(track => ({
                id: track.id,
                name: track.name,
                artist: track.artists[0].name,
                album: track.album.name,
                preview: track.preview_url,
                uri: track.uri
        }));


Track.js
In order to display a link to the preview, the following steps will be executed:
1. Add a ‘preview_button.png’ file to the Track folder.
2. Import the image in the Track.js file: 
import PreviewButton from './preview_button.png';
3. Add an href to the rendered <h3> line before displaying the track name:
<a href={this.props.track.preview} target='_blank'><img src={PreviewButton} height='18px' /></a>

CAVEATS
UX/UI Issue
This approach opens the preview in a new tab/window in order to not lose the search results. However, it may not be clear to the user what is happening. A second iteration of this feature would open the preview in a smaller pop-up window, following a user interface that is much more in line with user expectations.
